A basic system for developing fantasy rowing teams during the IRA season

Well here it is. I didn't think I'd ever actually share this code so it's uncommented and ugly. I will be updating it sporadically and try to make it more readable and editable.

The code is segmented into two parts. One part are the scrapers which are pretty self explanatory. One scrapes from worldrowing.com directly and another from a database worldrowing uses called rowingone.com. They are both in the athletes_raw folder

The second part is the parsers. One parser gets pretty much all the info from the available files in the athletes_raw folder. The other one just touches up on the names of the athletes which aren't formatted in the first parser. This system, mostly arose cause I'm lazy. I think I'll fix it soon.

Anyway, do what you will with this code, it's not useful enough to warrant making a license.
